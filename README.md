# OTelGen

## Background

Build a tool that:
1. Generates Otel data
2. Injects some more challenging data to stress test downstream processing pipelines

## FEEDBACK REQUESTED

This tool is half-vibed, half-written by hand. It's intended to be a hands-on, functioning prototype that can be experimented with, so we can build a more hardened version next.

We're especially interested in feedback along the lines of:

- Does the API on the CLI feel right?
- Does the aggro data injection feel appropriate?
- Is there enough control over the data going in/coming out?
- Are there other workflows we should consider architecting for?
